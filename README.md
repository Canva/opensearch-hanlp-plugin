# opensearch-analysis-hanlp

HanLP Analyzer for OpenSearch.

The OpenSearch clusters running in AWS use a version of this plugin that is maintained by AWS. AWS will not share the source for their version of the plugin, so Canva needs to maintain this copy of the HanLP plugin that can be used in tests running locally and in build pipelines.

This is OpenSearch 2.10.0 port of [hanlp language analyser plugin](https://github.com/KennFalcon/elasticsearch-analysis-hanlp).

This branch ([2.11.0-vanilla](https://github.com/pgtgrly/opensearch-analysis-hanlp/tree/2.11.0-vanilla)) contains minimal changes to the plugin code to build plugin for OpenSearch 2.11.0.

Please refer to branch [2.11.0](https://github.com/pgtgrly/opensearch-analysis-hanlp/tree/2.11.0) for enhancements and developments.
